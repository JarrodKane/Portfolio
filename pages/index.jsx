          The site is deployed and hosted on Netlify
          The content for the blog is pulled in from a headless CMS called Contentful.
          The content for the Podcast is grabbed from the podcasts RSS feed and then the pages are dynamically generated.
          

          The original aim of this site was to create a blog that would get content from Contentful, and was to try to use Tailwindcss.
          It now grabs content from Contentful, an RSS feed, and embeds livestreamed videos.
