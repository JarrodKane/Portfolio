# Next.js portfolio

LIVE VERSION [https://jarrodsite.netlify.app/](https://jarrodsite.netlify.app/).

Objective of this project is to use Next.js to create my own portfolio.
The Home page is meant to hold multiple sections, and the only other pages are Blog/Twitch/Youtube.
Blog pages will be populated by contentful.

The main reason behind this project is to try and use Tailwindcss.

The basic design for this site is made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/wLqVYuYcdFWoMFCHxxqA1c/JarrodKane?node-id=1%3A982).
The structure of this project is using atomic design.
The stying is using Tailwindcss, I was going to used styled-components but decided to try something different.
Prototyping is done using Storybook.

This is using:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
